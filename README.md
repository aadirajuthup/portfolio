# Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! Welcome to the code of my personal portfolio website, crafted with more modern toolkits like React, NextJS, Shadcn, etc... Dive into my world of web development, where clean design meets functionality. Enjoy browsing through my projects and get a glimpse of my coding journey!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
